## Testing
* There was a white line down the right had side which I fixed with padding. 
* The footer when on Mobile & Tablet was squashed together and you couldn’t tell where it started and finished. Using Media Queries I made bronze borders for when the screen size is less than 1200px to define each section of the footer. 
* The Service Page image is a woman coding, however the picture was too wide for mobile, I tried to crop it using GIMP 2.1 but it wasn’t very good. I opted to change it to an image of people working from a sheet of paper and a laptop when the screen size is less than 400 px. 
* On the Service page on mobile there is a white streak along the right hand side if you scroll left.
* HTML was tested using [W3C-Markup-Validation-Service:](https://validator.w3.org/) and has no issues. 
* CSS Was tested using [W3C-CSS-Validation-Service:](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and has 1 parse issue.
